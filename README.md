The results of the opcode-based-DNN were great,
with a validation accuracy of 95% and a dataset
accuracy of 97%. The results of the permissionbased-
DNN were satisfactory, with a validation
accuracy of 90%, or 90.6% and a training accuracy
of 95.2%. Malware had a 89.0% precision with
92.3% recall, while Benign had a 92.2% precision
with 89.0% recall.
The results of the permission-based-DBN were as
good as randomly selecting whether is malware or
not, or 50%.
